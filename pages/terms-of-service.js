                                    7.1 <b>Fees.</b> Subscriber will pay all fees specified in Service Orders and provide accurate and updated billing contact information. Except as set forth in a
                                    Service Order, all fees payable under the Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars. Minimum commitments in Service Orders are (a) based on Services purchased and not
                                    actual usage; (b) non-cancelable; and (c) cannot be decreased during the specified term. Fees paid for minimum commitments are not refundable. Subscriber’s payments
                                    of fees are neither (x) contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features nor (y) dependent on statements not set forth in the Agreement or any

                                    7.2 <b>Invoicing Terms.</b> If the Service Order specifies that payment will occur by a method other than a credit card, Subscriber will provide a purchase order
                                    number in the applicable amount (or reasonable alternative proof of Subscriber’s ability to pay the fees specified in a Service Order), and promptly notify
                                    Mediafirewall of any changes necessary for payment of an invoice. Mediafirewall will invoice Subscriber either monthly or according to the billing frequency stated
                                    in the Service Order. Invoices to be paid by credit card are due on the invoice date, all other invoices are due net 30 days from the invoice date. If any invoiced
                                    amount is not received by Mediafirewall by the due date, then without limiting Mediafirewall&apos;s rights or remedies: (a) those charges may accrue late interest
                                    at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower and (b) Mediafirewall may condition future
                                    subscription renewals and Service Orders on shorter payment terms. &nbsp;If Subscriber is paying for Services by credit card, Subscriber will provide

                                    changes necessary to charge the credit card. The provision of credit card information to Mediafirewall&apos;s authorized payment processer authorizes Mediafirewall,
                                    through its authorized payment processer, to charge the credit card for all Services specified in a Service Order, and any renewal subscription. Subscriber
                                    acknowledges that Mediafirewall will not have access to Subscriber’s credit card information.

                                    to be paid by credit card), Mediafirewall may, without limiting any rights and remedies, accelerate Subscriber’s unpaid fee obligations to become immediately due
                                    and payable, and block the provision of Services to Subscriber until the overdue amounts are paid in full. Mediafirewall will give Subscriber at least 10 days’
                                    prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with Section 19 (Manner of Giving Notice), before blocking Services to Subscriber.

                                    7.4 <b>Payment Disputes.</b> Mediafirewall will not exercise any rights to block Services, accelerate payments, impose late charges or change payment terms under
                                    Section 7.2 (Invoicing Terms) and Section 7.3 (Suspension of Service and Acceleration) with respect to an overdue amount for so long as Subscriber is disputing the
                                    overdue amount in good faith. The parties shall cooperate diligently to resolve the dispute.

                                    refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Service Orders after the effective date of termination. If the Agreement is terminated by
                                    Mediafirewall in accordance with Section 5.2 (Termination for Cause), Subscriber will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Service Orders.
                                    In no event will termination relieve Subscriber of its obligation to pay any fees payable for the period prior to the effective date of termination. If Subscriber
                                    terminates without cause prior to the end of the then current term, Subscriber shall be immediately liable for the balance of the fees for the remainder of the
                                    term.

                                    7.6 <b>Taxes.</b> Fees for Services do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example,
                                    value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, <b>“Taxes”</b>). Subscriber is responsible for paying all
                                    Taxes associated with its Service Orders. If Mediafirewall is obligated by law to pay or collect Taxes for which Subscriber is responsible, Mediafirewall will
                                    invoice Subscriber and Subscriber will pay that amount unless Subscriber can provide a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing
                                    authority. Subscriber will provide Mediafirewall any information Mediafirewall reasonably requests to determine whether Mediafirewall is obligated to collect Taxes.
                                    &nbsp;Mediafirewall is solely responsible for taxes assessable against its income, property, and employees.
